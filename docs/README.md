## About PS1 Input Viewer

This is a PS1 Input Viewer, developed by me. It displays the gamepad buttons being pressed while you play a PS1 game. Can be really helpful when recording walkthroughs, speedruns or tutorials of your favorite games.

## How to Use

Connect your PS1 Gamepad on a USB Port of your computer. Then, simply execute the "index.html" file in the root folder, and your navigator will open a new tab with the application (prefferably Chrome or Microsoft Edge).
